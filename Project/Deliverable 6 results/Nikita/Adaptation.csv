When complete, Houston will have added more than 3,000 acres of new and equitably distributed green spaces that can also serve the function of flood control and storm water quality enhancement. We will have also completed 80 new miles of continuous all-weather hike and bike trails that will meander through those greenways — an amenity unparalleled in the nation – that will provide a total network of 150 miles of greenspace and trails crisscrossing the city. When the project is complete, approximately 60 percent of Houstonians will live within 1.5 miles of a Bayou Greenway.There are numerous other benefits associated with utilizing our bayou corridors for green space and recreation:•	Reduced doctor visits due to increased access to recreation opportunities;•	Increase in use of alternative transportation for commuting along the hike and bike trails;•	Increase in property values along the corridor resulting in increased revenue to the city;•	Increased flood prevention due to the opportunity for wet-bottom detention areas in the newly created green spaces;•	Increased water quality due to the simple plantings located strategically along the bayous, the wet-bottom detention ponds, and reduced runoff;•	Increased air quality due to increased CO2 sequestration by newly planted trees and grasses, and use of trails for alternative transportation; and•	Change in Houston’s image to attract the best and brightest to our city.http://houstonparksboard.org/bayou-greenways-2020/2020/","(29.7601927, -95.3693896)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

One of these changes is related to rainfalls, which have increased by 29% in average over the past decades within the City. The main change was the increment in frequency and intensity of rains. The amount of water poured has been increasing over time but this phenomenon has occurred in the same amount of days as before. In conclusion, more rain is distributed in less time. This situation raises a problem: in the City of Buenos Aires every time it rains more than 40 mm in one hour, many places suffer floods and waterlogging, a recurrent problem that affects the whole city but especially to more than 90,000 people who are located in precarious settlements. Moreover, rain and severe wind can cause human losses,damages on the health system and property of the population, damage to urban infrastructure, as well as fallen trees and light poles which can produce power cuts. Buenos Aires Adaptation plan includes several measures to reduce the threat to the most-at-risk population; one of these actions includes the relocation of more than 591 families which were settled on the riverside in informal settlements. Furthermore, in areas with poor housing the city government has implemented urbanizations (provision of basic infrastructure services, public facilities, opening of streets, etc.) in order to reduce the vulnerability of citizens.  The government also does cleaning and removal of waste from the storm drain, along with the extension of green spaces to increase the absorption capacity. Civil Defense Department does maintenance work in public lighting and public trees to prevent them falling during severe storms.","(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"

It has actions for each epidemiological phase of the vector, ie from the egg, larvae and adult stages, in order to prevent its spread and infected population. In addition, actions are taken to eliminate artifacts that can accumulate water in homes (since these mosquitoes develop in peri or intra-domiciliary environments). To complement the actions, special sprays are made in public spaces such as schools and hospitals and ovitraps are placed in parks and squares of Buenos Aires, accompanied by actions to raise awareness of the population so that they can take the appropriate care from their role. Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency promotes the creation of a terrace garden of aromatic plants with the property to keep mosquitoes away, and they offer workshops of natural repellents, as a healthy, economic and chemical-free alternative, whose raw material is the plants planted in the terrace.","(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"

32480,City of Adelaide,Adelaide,Australia,South Asia and Oceania,,Public,2017,Extreme hot days,Diversifying power/energy supply,"South Australia is experiencing an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme hot days. As energy prices continue to rise, vulnerable and low income members of the community are often forced to consider whether they are able to afford the energy costs associated with air conditioning. An increase in extreme hot days can pose significant health and financial impacts for households that are trying to maintain healthy indoor temperatures. There are several barriers to the installation of solar PV systems for low income and rental households. These include access to upfront capital to purchase and install the solar PV systems; lack of clarity and trust in the solar market; and a split incentive between landlords and tenants, where landlords pay for the solar PV systems, while the tenant benefits from its installation. The Solar Savers Adelaide Program was designed in an attempt to overcome some of these barriers and to encourage the increased uptake of solar PV in residences within the City of Adelaide. Solar Savers Adelaide involves the City of Adelaide providing up front funding for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on eligible low-income and rental residential properties. Participating properties will have a ~2kW solar PV energy system installed on their property and Council will recover the costs from participating property owners for facilitating the supply and installation of the solar PV systems through a separate rate charge. The City of Adelaide continues to invest in energy efficiency measures and alternative energy supplies to reduce vulnerability.","(-34.928499, 138.600746)","(-25.274398, 133.775136)"

We talk of potentially damaging floods when water levels in streets, for example, reach 10 cm. It would be disproportionately expensive to implement adoptive measures in the city against events with return periods of more than 100 years when compared to the costs of the ensuing damage. Please note that the timescale for the implementation for cloud burst measures is estimated to 20 years, however the final implementation plan regarding all the planned cloud burst projects was adopted by november 2015. Action description The final implementation plan regarding all the planned cloud burst projects was adopted by november 2015. With a time frame of around 20 years before the Cloudburst Management Plan is fully implemented, it will be necessary to set a number of measures in motion in different water catchment areas simultaneously. This is not to say, however, that the adaptive action must be completed in one area before initiating activities elsewhere. The coordination of the pluvial flooding projects with ongoing urban development projects all over the city will mean that activities will be underway at several sites simultaneously, in any case.

The city Government has installed a system of  sensors to monitor the status level of the river, streams and rainwater ducts. This system measures and sends data on the capacity of the rainwater pipelines as well as environmental parameters to the Coordination and Control Center (CUCC, in its Spanish abbreviation). This center is a unique command and control center in Latin America, which has been designed and equipped with the latest technology allowing the City to coordinate rapid and integrated responses from all agencies for any type of disaster: flooding, police incidents complexes or health emergencies.  The Centre has a modern computing platform and communications system for the exclusive use of the security forces and emergency. It was created to coordinate the actions of civil, emergency, traffic and police agencies by working with information from ongoing monitoring of the main access roads to the city, parks and public spaces. It works, as well, receiving phone calls from neighbors to immediately activate all necessary resources for each emergency. Civil Defense Department organizes trainings for first respondents in low income settlements to strengthen self-defense capability of vulnerable populations, so they know how to act in case of flooding until emergency agencies come. If there was need for evacuations, the Civil Defense Area has identified a safety net, consisting of institutions (schools, clubs, churches) near vulnerable neighborhoods that can function as evacuation centers.","(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"

35995,City of Brasília,Brasília,Brazil,Latin America,,Public,2017,Drought,Incorporating climate change into long-term planning documents,"Adaptation to climate change plan (in progress).Para superar a escassez hídrica, diversas regras de racionalização do consumo de água foram estabelecidas desde o início da atual gestão. Em 2017, regiões abastecidas pelo Reservatório do Descoberto, responsável por 65% da produção total de água do DF, começaram a passar por rodízio no fornecimento,  esquema similar passou a valer nas regiões abastecidas pelo Reservatório de Santa Maria. Retirou-se chácaras que desviavam água da Barragem do Descoberto. As medidas de racionamento e fiscalização são necessárias para garantir a água no período da seca. Novas obras visam garantir abastecimento de água no DF. Para desafogar os reservatórios existentes, o governo de Brasília iniciou obras do Subsistema do Bananal que deverá levar água para 170 mil moradores do Plano Piloto, do Cruzeiro e do Lago Norte já a partir de 2017. É a primeira construção do tipo após 16 anos sem novos reservatórios no DF. O subsistema fica próximo ao Parque Nacional de Brasília e terá investimento de R$ 20 milhões. A bacia desafogará o reservatório de Santa Maria, responsável pelo abastecimento dessas três regiões administrativas.Há também um projeto para a retirada emergencial de água do Lago Paranoá. A medida está orçada em R$ 50 milhões e prevê instalação de uma balsa no espelho d’água para coleta de água e o bombeamento dela de contêineres até uma estação de tratamento. Outra obra em curso é a do Sistema Produtor Corumbá 4, próximo a Luziânia (GO). Em parceria com o governo de Goiás, a construção deve abastecer 1,3 milhão de pessoas nas duas unidades da Federação. Porém, as intervenções sob responsabilidade do estado vizinho estão interrompidas após recomendação do Ministério Público Federal (MPF), que investiga ilícitos em contratos e licitações da estatal goiana. Outras ações de prevenção à crise hídrica, são:– Ampliação do projeto Descoberto Coberto, com o plantio de mais de 100 mil mudas por parte da Companhia de Saneamento Ambiental (Caesb). Todas foram plantadas ao redor da área de proteção ambiental (APA) do Descoberto. A Secretaria da Agricultura, Abastecimento e Desenvolvimento Rural também começou a distribuir 330 mil mudas de espécies nativas a produtores por meio do programa Reflorestar. – Ampliação do programa Produtor de Água, que remunera o produtor rural que economizar água. Desde 2015, o investimento total previsto é de R$ 40 milhões para os próximos 10 anos e vem, principalmente, da Companhia de Saneamento Ambiental (Caesb). A expectativa é atingir 591 agricultores em toda a Bacia do Pipiripau.– Intensificação das ações da Agência de Fiscalização do DF (Agefis) em ocupações irregulares próximo a mananciais e córregos, como a desobstrução da orla do lago Paranoá, a desocupação do Condomínio Bougainville em Sobradinho e a retomada de área pública no Parque Ezechias Heringer, no Guará.– Avanço no projeto de captação de água do Lago Paranoá, com licitação lançada em 2015. As obras aguardam liberação de recursos federais (cerca de R$ 480 milhões). Pelos próximos 40 anos, serão atendidas 600 mil pessoas no Paranoá, no Lago Oeste, no Tororó, nos condomínios Jardim ABC, Jardim Botânico e Alphaville e em Sobradinho.– Retomada da captação de água do Córrego Crispim no Gama, em novembro de 2016, permitindo o abastecimento de cerca de 15 mil moradores da região e a consequente redução no consumo da Barragem do Descoberto.– Ativação do poço de São Sebastião para atender à comunidade no início de fevereiro de 2017.– Divulgação periódica de campanhas publicitárias de conscientização, feitas em parceria entre a Caesb e a Agência Reguladora de Águas, Energia e Saneamento (Adasa).– Publicação de decreto, em janeiro de 2017, com regras complementares para o funcionamento do Cadastro Ambiental Rural (CAR) e do Programa de Regularização Ambiental de Imóveis Rurais (PRA-DF), que incentiva a recuperação de nascentes e das matas ciliares, amenizando as mudanças no clima e protegendo a fauna e a flora.","(-15.794229, -47.882166)","(-14.235004, -51.92528)"

Some of the actions include: exploring policy and regulatory options to better protect vulnerable populations from extreme heat, investigating new and emerging research on health-based evidence for maximum temperature standards and improving the effectiveness of Toronto's Hot Weather Response Plan through ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the plan. The City also has a Harmonized Heat Alert and Response System (HARS) which notifies key response partners, community agencies, and the public to take the necessary actions to protect vulnerable groups from the effects of heat-related illness. Smog Alerts are issued to signal high health risk days (air quality health index readings of 7 or more) in Toronto. The City has a comprehensive smog action plan. The Corporate Smog Alert Response Plan involves City Agencies, Boards, Commissions and Divisions developing smog alert response plans specific to their functions.  Factors mitigating the impact of heat waves include the relative predictability of heat waves as compared to other shocks like extreme rainfall events. Toronto continues to explore policy and regulatory options to better protect vulnerable people; investigate new research on health-based evidence for maximum temperature standards, and build upon prior heat vulnerability mapping; 'cool room' pilots; community outreach and advocacy. In the event of a heat wave, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health is able to activate the corporate Hot Weather Response Plan which mobilizes resources to mitigate health impacts; e.g. the opening of cooling centres and follow-up with vulnerable populations.

31155,City of Buenos Aires,Buenos Aires,Argentina,Latin America,C40,Public,2017,Coastal flood,Real time risk monitoring,"Coastal floods are related to “Sudestada” phenomenon that includes severe southeast winds that push the river into land, not allowing drainage and it is usually accompanied by severe rainfall. This phenomenon may accelerate the river level rise in Buenos Aires. The wind that blows during Sudestadas is from the opposite direction from the normal flow of the Rio de la Plata, blocking its normal drainage pushing the water towards the coast and producing flooding. Faced with this situation the city has created an early warning system, which is provided by the underground information in real time on rainfall and storm effects in different neighborhoods of the City. It is equipped with water level sensors (limnigraphs) located in rainfall drainage systems which provide data of the amount of water concentrated in relation to pipe capacity during heavy rainfall events. In the same line, the City of Buenos Aires has a weather alert network run by the Emergency Squad which counts with eight stations.Within the Director of Emergency Plan, Sudestadas are considered one of the threats that the City faced, therefore have operational action plans to address them with the help from Civil Defense personnel. Although the phenomenon cannot be avoided, measures to mitigate its consequences are been developed: water reservoirs parks that hold rainwater, which will drain afterwards;and training of first responders.  The Coordination and Control Center (CUCC, in its Spanish abbreviation) monitors in real time critical city points and storm drains receive and process all emergency calls, coordinating response with the corresponding areas. Furthermore, the Ministry of Habitat and Inclusion and the Ministry of Urban Development does infrastructure improvements, tree planting among other actions in order to reduce vulnerability to coastal flooding. Moreover, the Buenos Aires Green Program plans to expand and improve the permeable green surface and the amount of public woodland, because of  the ability of these natural factors to absorb and retain rainwater.","(-34.6037232, -58.3815931)","(-38.416097, -63.616672)"

The drainage then discharges into a perennial stream near the 24th Street and Ivy Avenue intersection which is the southern boundary for the improvements. In addition to the above mentioned infrastructure improvements, the project team discovered an opportunity to simultaneously address flooding issues in a low-lying, under-utilized area of Blum Park, to enhance park aesthetics and operations, to improve water quality, and to help alleviate flooding.  Incorporating a constructed stormwater wetland in the bowl shaped area currently occupied by the old playground area will enable the aforementioned opportunities to be realized.  The playground would be relocated to an upland area convenient to an existing picnic shelter and restrooms.  While the low-lying area would then be re-graded to construct a wetlands facility with pre-treatment devices for litter, a forebay for removing heavier sediment, shallow marshes and deeper pools for pollutant removal, and an outlet structure to control stormwater discharges.  The wetland facility will also incorporate educational overlooks and signage to inform the public about the wetlands components and how they work to clean and protect surface waters (see attached rendering of the Blum Park wetland.","(36.0999, -80.2442)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

Environmental benefits of green roofs in an urban setting include the reduction of stormwater runoff into sewer system that could increase the risk of flooding. With the increasingly frequent and severe weather, it is essential that homeowners take the appropriate action to reduce the risk of basement flooding on their own private property.  To assist, the City offers owners of single-family, duplex and triplex residential homes a financial subsidy of up to $3,400 per property to install flood protection devices including a backwater valve, a sump pump, and pipe severance and capping of the home's storm sewer or external weeping tile connection","(43.653226, -79.3831843)","(56.130366, -106.346771)"

Green infrastructure involves greening elements that support a city such as street trees, green walls and roofs, community gardens and Water Sensitive Urban Design. Green spaces in cities provide cooling through shading and enhanced evapotranspiration, reducing the heat island effect in cities. Urban green areas can also have positive effects for human health; flood prevention and climate change adaptation. The Green Infrastructure Guidelines highlight public spaces and greening approaches which include Living Architecture and Water Sensitive Urban Design working together to create a more sustainable city. The guidelines also highlight a best practice approach to greening the City of Adelaide which include:•	Prioritising greening in the city through trees, street plantings, green roofs and walls, within Council's existing projects and asset renewal programs•	Identifying opportunities to add greening to Council owned buildings as a series of demonstration projects, including funding and staging requirements•	Foster and incentivising developers, business and community uptake of greening initiatives•	Pilot the greening of a representative residential pocket of the city, with a view to learning lessons that can be applied more broadly across the city.For more information about greening in the City of Adelaide visit adelaidedesignmanual.com.au/design-toolkit/greening.The City of Adelaide also has Green City Grant Program which encourages residents, businesses and property owners to create a pocket of greenery that adds to their street appeal and helps make the city’s streets and public spaces more attractive and enjoyable. Funding is available to cover up to half of the cost of each greening project. Grants start at $500 for residents and $1,000 for business and building owners, up to a maximum grant of $10,000 in matched funding.","(-34.928499, 138.600746)","(-25.274398, 133.775136)"

Whether the City experiences an extended heat wave, frigid temperatures or severe storms, the City must be prepared to assist Chicagoans in coping with weather-related hardships.  As such, the City of Chicago maintains an Extreme Weather Operations Plan. This Plan describes weather conditions that will merit the plan’s initiation, defines notification protocols for weather advisories, and describes departmental responsibilities and City operations during periods of extreme heat, cold, or severe storms.

Chicago is working proactively to respond to climate change by advancing policies and solutions to prepare for a changing climate and protect our people, infrastructure, and natural resources. Key actions that Chicago is taking include: •	Preparing for the human impacts of climate change by supporting people with information and services, such as cooling centers.•	Preparing the natural environment for climate impacts and maintain biodiversityThe City of Chicago understands that extreme weather conditions can have a severe impact on the health and safety of the residents of Chicago. Whether the City experiences an extended heat wave, frigid temperatures or severe storms, the City must be prepared to assist Chicagoans in coping with weather-related hardships.  As such, the City of Chicago maintains an Extreme Weather Operations Plan. This Plan describes weather conditions that will merit the plan’s initiation, defines notification protocols for weather advisories, and describes departmental responsibilities and City operations during periods of extreme heat, cold, or severe storms.  The Extreme Weather Operations Plan is maintained by the Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) and, with the cooperation of participating City departments and sister agencies, is reviewed annually, and updated as needed.","(41.8781136, -87.6297982)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"
